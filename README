# Frg
*The best programming language since it's named after frogs*

# What it looks like
```
struct Frog = {
	str name,
	int age,
	int leg_count,
}

map(str, int) frog_ages = { "greg": 2, "grog": 1, "josch": 712 }	
vec(Frog) swamp = []
frog_ages.iter().for_each((elem) {
	Frog new_frg = {
		name: elem.0
		age: elem.1,
		leg_count: 4,
	}
})
